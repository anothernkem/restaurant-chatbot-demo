We, five people, were traveling from the Dolomites in Italy to Stuttgart and stopped at B-West for dinner. It was a small restaurant with a delicious, extensive menu. The staff was very friendly and spoke several languages. We wouldn't miss Innsbruck if we had the chance; we'd happily stop at B-West again we recommend the Grill Plate Chicken, JBB chili cheese burger with extra bacon, chicken burger chicken fillet
