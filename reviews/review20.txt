It's always wonderful to enjoy a B-West Burger. They don't skimp on the ingredients, and the fries are also plentiful.

When I tried the "JBB Bad Ass Devil Ninja," the hidden ninja inside me awoke. I felt as strong, independent, and free as a ninja as this burger caressed my palate!! Give my regards to the chef! Brilliant work!!
