I ate a really cool burger today, with fries. What prompted me to write this review was the ketchup.
Don't get me wrong, everything was so amazing and next-level, really tasty... but the ketchup... such a great sauce... never eaten anything so amazing. It's just ketchup... but even that's homemade. With brains and common sense. Hey... it totally blows me away.
