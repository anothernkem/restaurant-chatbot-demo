I went to this place for dinner. The staff was very kind. I don't speak German, but there's an Italian-speaking counter attendant who was helpful and helped us choose and order our food, and even stayed to chat with us. The meat is delicious and high-quality, and they make an amazing garlic sauce. The place is clean, and you can sit outside to enjoy your meal. Highly recommended. If you're passing through Innsbruck, stop here for dinner.
