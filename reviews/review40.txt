A nice little snack bar across from Wifi Innsbruck. The staff and owner are extremely friendly and accommodating. The food is also really good, and those with a slightly spicier palate will definitely find something to their liking here. The Bosna burgers are huge and good, but the burgers are a mixed bag. I find the chili cheese burger a bit small for the price, for example. But all in all, a top-notch snack bar or fast food restaurant. I would also recommend either having the food delivered or picking it up, as there's very little space on site, and the size of the place means it smells strongly of fast food and grease.
