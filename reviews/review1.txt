We didn't have high expectations, but we were truly delighted. The burgers were fantastic, juicy, and bursting with flavor, and the fries… without exaggeration, perhaps the best we've ever tasted. We were served by the owner, and you could tell immediately – warm, attentive, quick, and genuine. Everything was relaxed, pleasant, and without any long waits.
