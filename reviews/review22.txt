One of the best places in Innsbruck to get really good food. Burgers, salads, side dishes, everything is always fresh, homemade, and delicious. Also a large veggie selection now! One of the few places where you can order something again and again without disappointment. So far delivery has always been very quick. If there are problems, it comes from the delivery provider, but not from the operator of the snack bar, who is very friendly and helpful.
